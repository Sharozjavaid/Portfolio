                        enhance their digital presence by improving the functionality, usability, and visual aesthetics
                        of their website. The main focus of the project was to create an engaging and intuitive user
                        experience, with the aim of improving visitor interaction and satisfaction.</p>

                    <h2 class="heading-7">Background</h2>

                    <p>When we were first assigned this project in the COGS 187B: Practicum in Professional Web Design
                        class, we were given the task to find a real-life client willing to work with us to enhance
                        their current website and digital presence. This assignment was designed to provide us with a
                        comprehensive and hands-on experience of the entire design process, mimicking the professional
                        work environment.

                        Understanding the gravity of the task and the opportunity at hand, I decided to extend my reach
                        beyond my immediate network. I posted ads on various online platforms, describing the project
                        and the potential benefits for the client. The idea was not just to find a client, but to find
                        the right client – one who would be committed and engaged in the process, offering a valuable
                        learning opportunity for me, and ideally benefiting from the proposed enhancements to their
                        digital presence.
                        <br><br>After sorting through several responses, I came across La Jolla Village Montessori
                        School. They had a significant need for a website overhaul, which aligned perfectly with our
                        project goals. Their existing website was outdated, lacked necessary functionalities, and was
                        not reflective of the school's progressive philosophy, resulting in a less than optimal user
                        experience for the school's community.

                        creativity and teamwork, enhanced my communication and project management capabilities, and
                        learned the importance of adaptability and continuous learning in the field of web

                        Each of these elements played a critical role in informing our design decisions and ensuring

                        steps.

                    <p> The first step in this phase was to create a mood board. This served as a visual guide, a means
                        to collect and express the aesthetic elements that would shape the website's design. It was a
                        collage of typography, color palettes, images, UI elements, and more, which together represented
                        the look and feel that would resonate with the La Jolla Village Montessori School community.
                        Every element was carefully chosen considering the school's brand, ethos, and target user base.

                    <p>Once we had a clear aesthetic direction, we moved onto wireframing. This step was like laying the
                        blueprint for the website. It allowed us to map out the user interface, establishing the
                        placement of elements, layout, and navigation. Each wireframe was crafted with a keen eye on
                        usability, ensuring a smooth, intuitive user journey throughout the site. The goal was to make
                        the website user-friendly and accessible, providing an effortless browsing experience for all
                        users - parents, staff, students, and prospective enrollees..<br><br><a

                        <p>After finalizing the wireframes, the next phase was to transform them into a high-fidelity
                            prototype. This was where the design truly came to life. All the components from the mood
                            board were applied to the wireframes, enhancing them with color, typography, and imagery.
                            The prototype presented a realistic representation of the website, almost identical to the
                            final product. It incorporated the full functionality, allowing us to interact with the UI,
                            test the navigation, and make any necessary adjustments to optimize usability. This
                            meticulous process ensured a seamless transition into the final implementation and launch

                    <p>In the user testing phase, we engaged with an assortment of users to evaluate the usability, functionality, and overall experience of our high-fidelity prototype. We chose a diverse group of testers that included parents, school staff, and others, who were likely to be part of the website’s primary audience. The methodology we used included both qualitative and quantitative data gathering through interviews, questionnaires, and observing users interact with the prototype. </p>

                    <li>
                        We discovered that our "summer camp and curriculum" boxes on our mobile home page appeared as a
                        single large box rather than two separate boxes containing separate information. We solved this
                        by separating the box headers.

                    <li>
                        Another issue we discovered in our first design was that our text blocks were too close
                        together, making it difficult for users to distinguish important information quickly. We solved
                        this problem by adding a semi-bold to highlight our important information and to add spacing
                        when possible between text

                    <li>
                        Our final concern discovered during user testing was our boxes on the parent resources page. Our
                        placement and sizing were judged awkward by users and needed to be adjusted. We addressed this
                        by resizing and then reorganizing our boxes.

                    <p>Overall, this project with La Jolla Village Montessori School was an invigorating journey,
                        weaving together real-world client engagement, team leadership, and the application of
                        sophisticated UX techniques.
                    </p>

                    <li> Navigating the client's vision and expectations was central to this project. It underscored the
                        importance of active listening, open communication, and regular updates, elements crucial in
                        fostering a successful and trust-based client relationship. Also working with the Montessori
                        School helped refine my skills in identifying and understanding a client's pain points,
                        particularly the issues related to their outdated website. This set the stage for targeted,
                        impactful design improvements.
                        <br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Leading the team gave me a hands-on experience in effective team coordination, task delegation,
                        and timeline maintenance. It honed my ability to capitalize on individual strengths within the
                        team, fostering an environment of collaboration and collective growth.
                        <br><br>
                    </li>

                    <li>A vital takeaway from this project was the value of an iterative design process. Continual
                        refinement based on user feedback allowed us to enhance the design significantly, proving that
                        design is a cycle of creation, evaluation, and iteration.
